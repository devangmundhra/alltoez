As you marvel at this gigantic monument, your kids can get the wiggles out in this large open space. While there’s no proper playground or climbing structure, the Plaza is usually fairly empty, which makes for a great space to run around.\r\n\r\nInspired by a set of round pagodas that existed in Nara, the ancient capital of Japan, the Peace Pagoda was donated to Japantown as a gesture of goodwill in 1968 by the City of Osaka, San Francisco's sister city in Japan. It has since become one of Japantown's main landmarks.	{"url":"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5166/5295105845_b2a76085b5_b.jpg","source_name":"","source_url":""}	0	100	0	2015-01-27	\N	http://www.californiajapantowns.org/sf/peaceplaza.html			Everyday		217	t	events_media/8e52f430-c1cb-413b-a6aa-688e08d4e75b.jpg
